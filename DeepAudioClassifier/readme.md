# Deep Audio Classifier for Capuchin Birds Calls

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a deep audio classifier designed to identify Capuchin bird calls. The project includes a comprehensive PDF document explaining the methodology, key findings, and insights obtained from the classifier.

## Files Included
- `DeepAudioClassifier_CapuchinbirdCalls.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook script containing the complete code for the deep audio classifier.
- `results.csv`: CSV file containing the results of the classifier on a set of audio recordings.
- `Project_Report.pdf`: A detailed report providing an in-depth understanding of the project, methodology, and results.

## Usage
1. Explore the Jupyter Notebook (`Deep_Audio_Classifier.ipynb`) for the detailed implementation of the deep audio classifier.
2. Review the `results.csv` file to examine the predictions made by the model on a set of audio recordings.
3. Refer to the comprehensive PDF document (`Project_Report.pdf`) for a detailed analysis of the project, key findings, and insights.
